Soup provides a complete example of using my rcmake with a real project.
rcmake generates a CMake-based build system for your projects.  See
https://github.com/danielgrigg/rcmake for more information.

Soup consists of a library, soup and test application, souptaste within the 
src and test hierarchies respectively. rcmake handles this use-case 
effortlessly, but can just as easily incorporate packages, platform-dependent 
layouts etc.  However, for accessibility soup doesn't have any external 
dependencies.

Usage
=====

Simply enter,
ruby rcmake.rb

This will generate build schemes under 'build/<your_platform>_debug' and 
'build/<your_platform>_release using your platform's default CMake Generator.
Soup can be installed from these folders.

rcmake forwards CMake options, so a specific generator can easily be used, ie:

ruby rcmake.rb -G Xcode

Which will generate Xcode projects in the scheme folders.
